# Class Repository Starter with RevealJS Slides

This repo is intented to be a quick template repo to use to start a new repository for a course which will use revealjs slides. It does use submodules to bring in the revealjs source as well as some plugins, and so should likely be cloned with
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jrembold/class_slides_template
```
